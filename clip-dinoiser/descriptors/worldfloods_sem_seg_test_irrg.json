  "land": [
    "solid, textured surface (fields, forests, urban areas) with varied patterns and colors",
    "non-reflective and stable, often with visible grid-like or natural patchwork patterns",
    "features terrain variations like hills, mountains, or valleys, creating shadows and gradients",
    "clear boundaries between natural land and human-made features (roads, buildings)",
    "dry, stable, with no signs of water pooling or saturation, sharp separation from water bodies"

  "water and flood": [
    "smooth, reflective surfaces with variable brightness due to sunlight or shadow",
    "flowing patterns in rivers or streams, with winding paths visible from above",
    "irregular, pooled shapes for floods, often submerging or surrounding land features",
    "may appear darker in color compared to land, with smoother, flowing contours",
    "in flood areas, debris or sediment may be visible, altering the water's texture or color"

  "cloud": [
    "soft, diffuse shapes, casting shadows over land or water from above",
    "white to dark grey, depending on weather conditions, with no sharp boundaries",
    "floats above the terrain, partially obscuring land or water below",
    "irregular, billowing forms that change size and density across the sky",
    "creates lighter or darker patches on the surface below due to varying cloud thickness"
